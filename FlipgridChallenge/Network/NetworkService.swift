// Out of scope: Not implementing the Networking part due to time constraints.
// If the project is going to get bigger, I would consider using Alamofire as that would make
// things easier on the API integration side.

// We could also use URLSession with protocol oriented approach to handle the networking. If mocking of network layer is essential, then we could think of injecting the URL session instance.
