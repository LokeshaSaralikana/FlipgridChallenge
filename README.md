# FlipgridChallenge

Overview
* The project follows MVVM-FlowViewController architecture that scales nicely as more screens/flows are added.
* I have added comments and TODOs/Out of Scopes througout the project.
* Validation is done only on Email and password fields.
* All the visual strings in the project have been localized.
* Displaying a default placeholder avatar in case a user hasn't selected an avatar during profile creation. This enhances the User experience compared to when no avatar is shown.
* The code is tested on iPad as well, should work without any issues. However, the UI layout could be more polished to suit the bigger screen.
* Added unit tests for viewmodels.

TODOs
* Add activity indicator when intergrating the API.
* Accessiblity support.
